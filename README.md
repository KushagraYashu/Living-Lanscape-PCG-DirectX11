Name: Kushagra\
Student Number: 2400020\
Project Name: Living Landscape II
  

##  Issues:

- To run the project from Visual Studio or any other IDE, some library files are needed which can be fetched using the `GetLibraries.bat` file. The batch can be found inside the `Coursework` folder. Path: `main/Coursework/GetLibraries.bat`

  

##  Project Description:

Living Landscape II is continuation of Living Landscape I [(GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/KushagraYashu/Living-Landscape-DirectX11).  It introduces procedural methods such as volumetric rendering and Perlin Noise manipulated dynamically tessellated terrain.

  

###  General Features
- Perlin Noise-Based Geometry Manipulation
- Lighting and Shadows
- LOD-Adaptive Dynamic Tessellation
- Collision Detection
- Post-Processing
- UI Controls

### Gameplay
The application introduces basic gameplay mechanics to engage the user. Players have to navigate the terrain to collect coins distributed across the environment and return them to a house located on the map.

### Advanced Features
- **Volumetric Rendering**

	- Self-research was carried out on volumetric rendering techniques, resulting in the implementation of physically-based clouds in Living Landscape II. The cloud system models several important physics techniques, including Beerâ€™s Law of light absorption in fluids, in scattering and out-scattering of light, variable density using a Perlin noise 3D density texture, depth checks against scene geometry for accurate depth perception, and additional fluid dynamic principles.
